As we witness the rise of Web 3.0 and shift in paradigm of technology. The world is moving towards decentralisation 
with DeFi (Decentralised Finance) which uses smart contracts and trustless protocols to facilitate peer-to-peer financial 
services on the network and DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous systems) which can be though of as internet-native business 
that's collectively owned and managed by its members.When it comes to managing funds, you can't always trust a random 
person let alone trusting someone you've never met or seen. With DAO's code the whole process becomes actually democratic 
where decision of each and everyone matters and all at the same time you don't have to trust or know anyone else in the group.
The funds are locked and are inaccessible by any single person and only with consensus on community proposals funds can be disbursed.
The whole process is fully Transparent and public to be examined/verified by anyone.

Along with these there are many Awesome projects out there changing the game everyday.
Let's list and read about a few among them:

## Osmosis
Osmosis is the first Decentralised Exchange (DEX) connecting various projects through Interblockchain Communication Protocol 
(IBC). Built using Cosmos SDK, Osmosis is called a Laboratory of automated market makers (AMMs). 
Osmosis facilitates for developers to design their own AMM decentralised application (dApp).  
Osmosis' user and developer friendly Webapp makes the entire process of crypto exchange a piece of cake. 
With yet another awesome feature called community pools, Osmosis helps you stay connected and be an integral part of the projects 
you support. By providing liquidity to their pools, you help building the ecosystem and simultaneously reaping rewards.

## Akash Network
Akash is another trending project that has been a topic of discussion around the communities. Akash Network is a 
distributed Peer-to-Peer marketplace for Cloud Compute that provides a fast and efficient application deployment solutions.
Akash Network leverages on underutilized cloud capacity around the globe enabling anyone to buy and sell cloud computing.

and how we collaborate with Akash <a href="https://blog.openregistry.dev/Collaboration" target="_blank">here</a>

## Filebase
filebase is an AWS S3 Compatible Object Storage powered by Web3.
Storing 1TB of files on Filebase costs $5 per month, compared with ~$23 for Amazon S3.
filebase is one of the simplest and most affordable ways to store your data. 
Filebase also supports multipart uploads on Sia using AWS CLI, moreover the AWS CLI is certified for use with Filebase. 
With over 2 years in market, filebase has collaborated with many ecosystems like Akash, IPFS, Skynet, Storj, Comet creating a 
huge impact. Crypto Communities have certainly taken a shine to Filebase who was also a finalist in Storage Magazine’s 
2019 Products of the Year Award. Read more about filebase <a href="https://filebase.com" target="_blank">here</a>


## IPFS and FileCoin:
IPFS (Interplanetary File System) is the future of WEB with its aim to surpass HTTP and bring a better web for all of us.
IPFS is peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge by making the web upgradeable, 
resilient, and more open. The average lifespan of a web page is 100 days before it's gone forever. The medium of our era 
shouldn't be this fragile. IPFS makes it simple to set up resilient networks for mirroring data, and thanks to content addressing,
files stored using IPFS are automatically versioned. With IPFS, content is accessible through peers located anywhere in the world, 
that might relay information, 
store it, or do both. IPFS knows how to find what you ask for using its content address rather than its location.
IPFS is OpenRegistry's next in line collaboration resort. We are super psyched to begin integration with IPFS and take OpenRegistry to next level

## Skynet
Skynet is an open protocol for hosting data and web applications on the decentralized web using <a href="https://sia.tech" target="_blank">Sia</a>
This allows the data to be available across the globe to any application with any device and is completely controlled by user. 
This also means the data is not stored on any central entity or controlled by it. Skynet code is open source and is operated by SkynetLabs, 
Skynet is built on top of the Sia blockchain network, which is also open-source and guided by the Sia Foundation.

OpenRegistry collaborates with skynet <a href="https://blog.openregistry.dev/Collaboration" target="_blank">here</a>

## Arweave
Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers 
to truly store documents and Applications forever. On top of the Arweave network lives the permaweb: a global, 
community-owned web that anyone can contribute to or get paid to maintain. The permaweb looks just like the normal web, 
but all of its content – from images to full web apps – is permanent, retrieved quickly, and decentralized – forever. 
Just as the first web connected people over vast distances, the permaweb connects people over extremely long periods of time.

## Juno
Juno is a permission-less interoperable smart contract network which automatically executes, controls or documents a 
procedure of relevant events and actions according to the terms of such contract or agreement to be valid & usable across 
multiple sovereign networks. The Juno blockchain is built using the Cosmos SDK framework. A generalized framework that simplifies
the process of building secure blockchain applications on top of Tendermint BFT. It is based on two major principles: 
Modularity & capabilities-based security. Learn more about Juno project <a href="https://www.junonetwork.io/" target="_blank">here</a>

## Solana
Solana is an open source project implementing a new, high-performance, permissionless blockchain. 
A blockchain built from the ground up for scale. The goal of the Solana architecture is to demonstrate there exists a set 
of software algorithms that when used in combination to implement a blockchain, removes software as a performance bottleneck, 
allowing transaction throughput to scale proportionally with network bandwidth. The architecture goes on to satisfy 
all three desirable properties of a proper blockchain: it is scalable, secure and decentralized.

## Valist.io
Valist is a web3-native software distribution system that glues web3 protocols like Ethereum/Polygon, IPFS, 
and Filecoin together into a simple interface that enables  publishing software with your web3 identity, 
fetching software, Over-the-air auto-update systems, DAO- coordinated software releases, public goods funding 
mechanisms and much more. Learn more about Valist <a herf="https://valist.io/">here</a>
