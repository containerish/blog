>A breath of our inspiration  
Is the life of each generation;  
A wondrous thing of our dreaming  
Unearthly, impossible seeming â€”  
The soldier, the king, and the peasant  
Are working together in one,  
Till our dream shall become their present,  
And their work in the world be done.
 -- Ode, O'Shaughnessy

OpenRegistry is about the work done together. We were first just an idea which lead into developing a project to win 
Hackathon. It was the collaboration (with Akash, Skynet and among ourselves) that kept pushing us to develop 
OpenRegistry with determination we are able to build OpenRegitry with full force.

Under [Containerish](https://github.com/containerish), OpenRegistry is an initiative towards Web 3.0. 
To build decentralised applications and develop tool-chains to support Web 3.0 Teams and Communities.
We have so far collaborated with Akash Network & Skynet. We working on collaborating with IPFS and Filebase. 
Containerish should become a hub of collaborations as there come more projects like OpenRegistry.

## Akash Network
Akash Network is a distributed marketplace for cloud compute. The beginning of OpenRegistry was with Akash.
We worked hand in hand with Akash Network to deploy OpenRegistry and explore possibilities of making the developer experience 
seamless. Akash Network hosted a Hackathon in July of 2021 called Open Cloud challenge in collaboration with Skynet, 
where OpenRegistry was the winner.  
Shortly after, we engaged with CAB (Community Awards Board) at Akash Network for a grant funding to continue developing OpenRegistry.
Following are the individual posts:

[OpenRegistry - an Open Container Registry](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-an-open-container-registry/76)  
[OpenRegistry - Beta Registration](https://forum.akash.network/topenregistry-an-open-and-reliable-container-registry/515)  
[OpenRegistry - Community Proposal](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-community-proposal/684)  
[OpenRegistry - OCI Certification](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-is-now-oci-certified/3317)  
[OpenRegistry - Roadmap](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-product-update/3745)


Akash community continues to support OpenRegistry through CAB and active community members on each step helping us achieve 
our milestone as mentioned in our [Roadmap](https://forum.akash.network/t/openregistry-product-update/3745)
With new Persistent storage feature, Akash has made it even more reliable to host applications without having to worry 
about losing your deployments.
We are all but thankful for Akash and their solid companionship.

## Inter Planetory File System (IPFS)

IPFS is a peer-to-peer
> with IPFS, OpenRegsitry only stores content hashes of your container images.
> It is just like a pointer, i.e storing the address of the content instead of the content itself.

With more adoption and use, OpenRegistry is moving towards accomplishing it's Goal which is to make OpenRegistry free for everyone.

## Collaborations in Progress

As OpenRegistry grows in code and in community's hearts, we are working on collaborating with more awesome projects out there. 
The first in our list is [Filebase](https://filebase.com/). Through Filebase: We will be able to connect with multiple decentralised storage 
networks which means collaboration with more platforms.

We are also planning on collaborating with [iExec](https://iex.ec/) which will allow us have a choice in hosting just like storage backends with above collaborations.
